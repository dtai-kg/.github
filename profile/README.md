# Knowledge Graphs at DTAI division of KU Leuven
Welcome to DTAI's works related to knowledge graphs!

In this GitHub organization, you can find the software we develop to support our research.

### **MLSea** 

MLSea (http://w3id.org/mlsea/) includes a set of software developed to create and explore metadata about ML concepts.
It consists of:
- **MLSea-KGC** (https://github.com/dtai-kg/MLSea-Discover) provides the source code used to create MLSea-KG.
- **MLsea-KG** (http://w3id.org/mlsea-kg) is a knowledge graph with concepts related to ML.
- **MLSO** (https://w3id.org/mlso) is an ontology to describe ML related topics.
- **MLSeascape** (http://w3id.org/mlseascape) is a UI to search over the MLSea knowledge graph.

### **SCOOP** 

SCOOP extracts constraints from the data's schema, ontology and mappings to create SHACL shapes.
It consists of:
- **SCOOP** (https://github.com/dtai-kg/SCOOP) integrates SHACL shapes which were extracted from different artifacts.
- **XSD2SHACL** (https://github.com/dtai-kg/XSD2SHACL) extracts SHACL shapes from XMLSchema.
- **SCOOP-UI** (https://github.com/dtai-kg/SCOOP-UI) provides a user interface to interact with SCOOP and extract SHACL shpes.
