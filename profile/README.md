# Knowledge Graphs at DTAI division of KU Leuven
Welcome to DTAI's works related to knowledge graphs!

In this GitHub organization, you can find the software we develop to support our research.

### **MLSea** 

[MLSea](http://w3id.org/mlsea/) includes a set of software developed to create and explore metadata about ML concepts.
It consists of:
- **MLSea-KGC** (https://github.com/dtai-kg/MLSea-KGC) provides the source code used to create MLSea-KG.
- [**MLsea-KG**](http://w3id.org/mlsea-kg) is a knowledge graph with concepts related to ML.
- [**MLSO**](https://w3id.org/mlso) (https://github.com/dtai-kg/MLSO) is an ontology to describe ML related topics.
- [**MLSeascape**](http://w3id.org/mlseascape) (https://github.com/dtai-kg/MLSeascape) is a UI to search over the MLSea knowledge graph. ([video](https://youtu.be/jn-GGwm52EM?feature=shared))

The research on MLSea is partially funded by the following projects: 
[KG4ML](https://research.kuleuven.be/portal/nl/project/3E220028), 
[REXPEK](https://rexpek.github.io/) and
[FAIR](https://www.flandersairesearch.be/en).

### **SCOOP** 

[SCOOP](https://dtai-kg.github.io/SCOOP/) extracts constraints from the data's schema, ontology and mappings to create SHACL shapes.
It consists of:
- **SCOOP** (https://github.com/dtai-kg/SCOOP) integrates SHACL shapes which were extracted from different artifacts.
- **XSD2SHACL** (https://github.com/dtai-kg/XSD2SHACL) extracts SHACL shapes from XMLSchema.
- [**SCOOP-UI**](https://demos.citius.usc.es/scoop/#doc) (https://github.com/dtai-kg/SCOOP-UI) provides a user interface to interact with SCOOP and extract SHACL shapes.

The research on SCOOP is partially funded by the following projects: 
[KG3D](https://w3id.org/kg3d/)

### **TorchicTab**
TorchicTab automatically understands tables and provides annotations for these tables.

You can read more about TorchicTab at DTAI's stories: https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/stories/post/anastasia-dimou/torchictab/

The research on TorchicTab is partially funded by the following projects: 
[KG3D](https://w3id.org/kg3d/),
[REXPEK](https://rexpek.github.io/) and
[FAIR](https://www.flandersairesearch.be/en).


### **Ontologies**
- [**MLSO**](https://w3id.org/mlso) (https://github.com/dtai-kg/MLSO) is an ontology to describe ML related topics.
- [**CACAO**](http://w3id.org/cacao/) (https://github.com/REEVALUATE/CACAO) is an ontology to describe cultural heritage artifacts.
- [**GLUE**](https://w3id.org/glue) (https://github.com/dtai-kg/GLUE-Ontology) is an ontology to describe ML related topics.
